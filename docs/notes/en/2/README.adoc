=== running `sshd`

keep in mind that running `sshd` on _ubuntu_, starts server in current
user scope, and won't start it system-wide. thus, when running these commands:

. `/usr/sbin/sshd` and then
. `systemctl start sshd`

you get `inactive` as the response. so, to start server system-wide just run
the following command:

----
systemctl start <sshd | ssh>
----

now, after running `system status sshd` command, you'll find its status changed
to `active`.

_This is only done to ease management of ssh server through `systemctl`
commands_

[discrete]
=== `sshd.service` not found on ubuntu

. `sudo apt purge openssh-server`
. `sudo apt install openssh-server -y`

here, the `purge` command is what makes the difference.

[discrete]
=== ssh config file

when you start system-wide ssh server through `systemctl`, you should edit
global config file which is usually located in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config/`.

configuring server through `sshd -f <your-config-file>` is done only when you start
client-wide ssh server.

[discrete]
=== which key where

small reminder here

* remote `hostkey` \-> local `known_hosts`
* local `publickey` \-> remote `authorized_keys`

== dynamic port forwarding

to configure dynamic port forwarding, ssh makes use of `socks` protocol. thus
general syntax is:

----
ssh -D <local-port> <remote-username>@<remote-host>
----

then i wanted to enter something like this in firefox search bar

`localhost:8000`

to get into my vmware machine, but firefox wouldn't allow me to. after some
searching, i've found this issue described here

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/532292/browsing-localhost-via-ssh-socks-tunnel-not-working

the thing is, is that firefox browser won't tunnel `localhost` address through
proxy, thus you need to change firefox internal configuration in order to
force it:

. type `about:config` in search bar, then accept all risks and continue
. change `network.proxy.allow_hijacking_localhost` to true

that's it. now you can proxy you `localhost` address w/ firefox. but keep in
mind that these settings vary between different browsers.
