# website: new workflow

my current workflow of maintaining the website consists of:

* *markdown* for marking up the document
* *pandoc* for generating html pages
* *bash* for some of my small scripts that generate the whole website
  * <https://github.com/m7tkr/www/tree/main/docs/scripts>

as i said earlier, i'm considering transition from markdown to asciidoc.
as it turned out, using asciidoc w/ pandoc and bash is very time-consuming for
generating html pages. thus i've decided to learn hugo
(static website generator written in golang) <https://gohugo.io/> for
its support of asciidoc, and, as such, replacing both of pandoc and bash.

i really want to start publishing new content here using hugo, and getting
started w/ it requires quite some effort. so for some time my notes won't
appear here until the time i get used to hugo. but you can still check out
my git repo at <https://github.com/m7tkr/www/tree/main/docs/notes>.

thanks for the time you spent reading this, and let's get busy.
