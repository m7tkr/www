# enterpreneurship: skills

self-improvement is important in enterpreneurship. and it is well known that
two types of skills should be improved. these are soft and hard skills. below
are my own thoughts on which resources should be used.

## soft skills

* all the books of robert greene
* some books that go under the title of emily post

although these both don't go well with each other

## hard skills

for hard skills you can:

* study real-world business cases
* learn fundamentals of business
